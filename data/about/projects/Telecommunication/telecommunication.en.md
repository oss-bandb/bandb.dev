For an IT service provider working in the telecommunications industry, we were responsible for the further development of a client-side SDK, which is developed in-house.  The SDK communicates with a server via APIs generated by OpenAPI. We extended the APIs and integrated them into the SDK. The new features, among others Consent-Management, were implemented for the app of a larger customer the company serves. The UI design for the app was created by a designer in the tool Figma, which was subsequently implemented by us. The planning was done according to agile methodologies.
