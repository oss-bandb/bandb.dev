Another video streaming platform is to be extended by a native Android app. Our task was to implement the UI layer first and then the other layers. It should be emphasised that we used Jetpack Compose (Android's new UI framework toolkit) for the first time for the UI implementation. The playback of videos, advertising integration, the development of a specially balanced advertisement system and the integration of analytics were also integral parts of the project.
