For a company that sells B2B a emergency system, we were hired to refactor the code base on all layers and to continue developing and optimising the functional scope. To avoid a feature stop, it was decided to do the refactoring iteratively. In addition, algorithms for fall detection and BLE beacons for indoor positioning were developed.
