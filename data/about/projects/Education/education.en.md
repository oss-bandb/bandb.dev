An app for educational institutions is extended by a new feature. Data is provided by a second backend system through a REST interface, which was integrated into the app. The app will be extended by a registration feature, authentication with token management (JWT) and different interfaces to display or change data through the given REST API. In addition, there were other activities such as consulting and maintenance over a longer period of time.
